            <h2>GPS Tracking</h2>
            <p>                
I've been actively involved in the GPS tracking project, working on creating a comprehensive system for real-time monitoring and analysis of vehicle activities. For the backend, we've employed Laravel, Go for interfacing with OBD2 devices, and integrated IoT cell connectivity for a multi-faceted approach. On the mobile side, we're using Kotlin and Swift, offering Bluetooth connectivity for BYOD GPS tracking.
</p><p>
Some key features we've incorporated into the system include push notifications and geofencing capabilities. This ensures that timely alerts are sent via the mobile app or SMS when a vehicle enters or exits predefined geographic boundaries. But we didn't stop at basic tracking—we've gone a step further by integrating advanced analytics. The system calculates trip times, providing valuable insights into vehicle usage patterns. Additionally, we're using sophisticated algorithms to monitor various metrics like RPM, fuel consumption, idle time, and speed.
</p><p>
Our GPS tracking solution is shaping up to be a robust and versatile tool, offering a user-friendly interface for both web and mobile platforms. The seamless blend of technologies, including Laravel, Go, Kotlin, and Swift, showcases our commitment to delivering a powerful and efficient end-to-end tracking experience.

            <h2>Network Monitoring</h2>
            <p>
                
                I've been deeply involved in the Network Monitoring project, working on building a robust system to ensure the seamless and efficient operation of our network infrastructure. Using Golang and VueJS, we've developed this project to excel in monitoring network equipment through various protocols like SNMP, sFlow, and NetFlow. The goal is to proactively identify and address potential issues, providing a comprehensive solution for network administrators.
            </p><p>
                Some key functionalities we've integrated into the project include real-time monitoring of network devices and alerting for throughput issues, device downtime, and unusual packet flows. The system dynamically captures interfaces, adapting to the online status of interfaces like PPPoE on Mikrotik, Cisco, and Juniper devices. This flexibility ensures that we have accurate and up-to-date information for effective network management.
            </p><p>                
                One standout feature is our alerting mechanism, which utilizes SMS, email, Slack, and Teams notifications. This multi-channel approach ensures that our network administrators are promptly informed of critical events, enabling swift response and issue resolution.
            </p><p>
                We're not stopping there—the project is continuously evolving. Currently, we're working on a dynamic mapping feature that aims to visualize the network topology based on the SNMP data we collect. This will provide us with an intuitive and insightful map of the entire network. This additional layer of visualization enhances the project's capabilities, making it a comprehensive and indispensable tool for network monitoring and management.

            <h2>OBD2 Hardware</h2>
            <p>
                I've been deeply immersed in the OBD2 Hardware Design project, and it's been quite an intricate journey. The project revolves around a comprehensive review of regulatory requirements in the United States and Canada for OBD2 devices. Using the C programming language, I'm working on an STM32 microcontroller with Texas Instruments components, aiming for robust performance and adherence to industry standards.
</p><p>
The initial phase involves a meticulous examination of regulations governing OBD2 devices in both the US and Canada, including those set forth by bodies like the FCC. Compliance is a top priority, especially with the stringent guidelines related to noise levels and component specifications.
</p><p>
When it comes to hardware design, I've been hands-on in selecting components for the OBD2 device. It's a detailed process of choosing components that not only meet regulatory standards but also ensure optimal functionality. The circuit design is crafted to seamlessly integrate with OBD2 interfaces, providing accurate and reliable data.
</p><p>
On the software front, I'm writing code in C to control the STM32 microcontroller and interact with Texas Instruments components. The software is designed to enable efficient communication with OBD2 interfaces, ensuring accurate collection and processing of vehicle diagnostic data.
</p><p>
Additionally, the project delves into the evaluation and selection of cellular modems, considering regulatory considerations for connectivity. Given the complexity of US regulations, especially those from the FCC, I'm scrutinizing the impact of noise and component choices on compliance. This thorough review ensures that the cellular modem integration aligns with regulatory requirements, enabling seamless and compliant communication.
</p><p>
In essence, the OBD2 Hardware Design project is a meticulous journey covering regulatory compliance, hardware design, component selection, and software development. By upholding the highest standards in both design and coding, my goal is to create a reliable and regulatory-compliant OBD2 device with seamless cellular connectivity.
